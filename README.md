# Islaris: verification of machine code against authoritative ISA semantics

## Setup

It is recommended to install the dependencies of Islaris via opam
(version 2.0.0 or newer) into a new switch. This can be done via the
following commands. You also need to make sure that you have the GNU
GMP library on your system (`libgmp-dev` package on Debian),
aarch64-linux-gnu-as (`binutils-aarch64-linux-gnu` package on Debian,
`aarch64-elf-binutils` package on MacOS) and
riscv64-linux-gnu-as (`binutils-riscv64-linux-gnu` package on Debian, `riscv64-elf-binutils` on MacOS).

```
opam switch create . ocaml-variants.4.14.0+options ocaml-option-flambda --no-install
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam repo add iris-dev https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/opam.git
make builddep
```

You might need to run `eval $(opam env)` afterwards to update the environment of your shell.

The Islaris frontend also requires cloning and setting up Isla ( https://github.com/rems-project/isla )
and Isla snapshots ( https://github.com/rems-project/isla-snapshots ) in a directory next to
the Islaris repository:
```
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/rems-project/isla.git
git clone https://github.com/rems-project/isla-snapshots.git
# Follow the instructions in https://github.com/rems-project/isla/blob/master/README.md to setup Isla
```
(Alternatively, one can also set the "ISLA_REPO" and "ISLA_SNAP_REPO" environment variables
to point to a working checkout of Isla resp. Isla snapshots.)

The following commits of isla and isla-snapshots are tested:
```
isla: b8e614bda4a20e42c37d8b216853653133d04322
isla-snapshots: b58da9170470a422c9396983ac8f87f0a63ba6f8
```

Once all needed libraries have been installed, Islaris can be built by running `make` from its root directory.

## Generating Coq traces from a partial decompilation of pkvm

Currently, one needs to manually instrument the output of `objdump` so that it
contains only the relevant code.

For example, we can start from the following segment of `objdump` output taken
from an exception handler in pkvm:
```
    7400:	a9bf07e0 	stp	x0, x1, [sp, #-16]!
    7404:	d53c5200 	mrs	x0, esr_el2
    7408:	d35afc00 	lsr	x0, x0, #26
    740c:	f100581f 	cmp	x0, #0x16
    7410:	54ff9f81 	b.ne	6800 <__host_exit>  // b.any
    7414:	a94007e0 	ldp	x0, x1, [sp]
    7418:	f1000c1f 	cmp	x0, #0x3
    741c:	54ff9f22 	b.cs	6800 <__host_exit>  // b.hs, b.nlast
    7420:	910043ff 	add	sp, sp, #0x10
    7424:	58001ea5 	ldr	x5, 77f8 <__kvm_hyp_host_forward_smc+0x64>
    7428:	d2800006 	mov	x6, #0x0                   	// #0
    742c:	f2a00006 	movk	x6, #0x0, lsl #16
    7430:	f2c00006 	movk	x6, #0x0, lsl #32
    7434:	f2e00006 	movk	x6, #0x0, lsl #48
    7438:	cb0600a5 	sub	x5, x5, x6
    743c:	d61f00a0 	br	x5
```
We then manually annotate it with constraints as in the following:
```
//@constraint: = (bvand (bvadd SP_EL2 0x0000000000000008) 0xfff0000000000007) 0x0000000000000000
//@constraint: = (bvand (bvsub SP_EL2 0x0000000000000010) 0xfff0000000000007) 0x0000000000000000
    7400:	a9bf07e0 	stp	x0, x1, [sp, #-16]!
    7404:	d53c5200 	mrs	x0, esr_el2
    7408:	d35afc00 	lsr	x0, x0, #26
    740c:	f100581f 	cmp	x0, #0x16
    7410:	54ff9f81 	b.ne	6800 <__host_exit>  // b.any
//@constraint: = (bvand SP_EL2 0xfff0000000000007) 0x0000000000000000
//@constraint: = (bvand (bvadd SP_EL2  0x0000000000000008) 0xfff0000000000007) 0x0000000000000000
    7414:	a94007e0 	ldp	x0, x1, [sp]
    7418:	f1000c1f 	cmp	x0, #0x3
    741c:	54ff9f22 	b.cs	6800 <__host_exit>  // b.hs, b.nlast
    7420:	910043ff 	add	sp, sp, #0x10
//@constraint: = (bvand 0x00000000000077f8 0xfff0000000000007) 0x0000000000000000
    7424:	58001ea5 	ldr	x5, 77f8 <__kvm_hyp_host_forward_smc+0x64>
    7428:	d2800006 	mov	x6, #0x0                   	// #0
    742c:	f2a00006 	movk	x6, #0x0, lsl #16
    7430:	f2c00006 	movk	x6, #0x0, lsl #32
    7434:	f2e00006 	movk	x6, #0x0, lsl #48
    7438:	cb0600a5 	sub	x5, x5, x6
    743c:	d61f00a0 	br	x5
```
and write the result to a file named `pkvm_handler/pkvm_handler.dump`. Note
that lines with a `//@constraint: ...` annotation apply to the next line with
an instruction. Empty lines, comment lines (starting with `//` not immediately
followed by `@`), as well as label lines found in objdump output are ignored.
See file `examples/binary_search.dump` for a more complete example of valid
syntax.

To run the development version of `isla-footprint` (necessary for `islaris`),
we provide a script in `bin/isla-footprint` that must be placed in the `PATH`.
```sh
# Run this command at the root of the repo.
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
```
We can then run the front end with the following command:
```sh
dune exec -- islaris pkvm_handler/pkvm_handler.dump
```
This will generate one Coq file per address containing the trace for the instruction at
that address and a file called `instrs.v` containing a mapping from addresses to
traces. `instrs.v` may need to be manually modified to correctly qualify imports.

Note that you can also extend the `PATH` directly when calling `islaris`, by
using the following command instead.
```sh
# This assumes you are at the root of the repo.
PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH dune exec -- islaris pkvm_handler/pkvm_handler.dump
```

## Building other examples

Islaris ships with other examples under directory `examples`.
To build these, run `make generate`. To build an individual example,
consult the Makefile for the correct keyword to use (for instance,
the `unaligned_accesses` example can be built with 
`make generate_unaligned_accesses`).
Building examples with a `make generate_` command will correctly place
the output files under directory `instructions`, in a folder
with the same name as the example.
